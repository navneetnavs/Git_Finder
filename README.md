# Git_Finder
This project is a web application that allows users to search for GitHub users by their username. 
It uses the GitHub API to retrieve user data, including their profile information, repositories, and followers.
The user's profile information is displayed in a user-friendly format. This project was built using JavaScript,
HTML, CSS, and the GitHub API. The challenges I faced were learning how to use the GitHub API and how to display
the user data in a user-friendly format. I overcame these challenges by reading the documentation for the GitHub API 
and by experimenting with different ways to display the user data. In the future, I plan to add more features
to this project, such as the ability to filter results by language or location.
